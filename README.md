The aim is to classify Iris Flowers among three species(Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginia) from sepals and petals' length and width measurements.
The Iris dataset is a CSV file containing 150 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width, and Class(Species).
The central goal here is to design a model that makes useful classifications for new flowers or in other words, one which exhibits good generalization.
The data source is the file iris.csv. It contains the data for this example in comma-separated values(CSV) format.
